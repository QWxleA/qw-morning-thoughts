# Morning thoughts ðŸ’­ 
This (small) plugin is based on the following idea:
> When I open my note-taking app first thing in the morning ask what Iâ€™m currently thinking about. Once Iâ€™ve marked this complete, show me what I said yesterday, three days ago, and last week. â€“ [Programmable Notes](https://maggieappleton.com/programmatic-notes) Maggie Appleton

## Daily Notes Integration

This plugin automatically adds and updates or adds *"todaysThought"* in your daily note's frontmatter. The format will be:

```yaml

```

Everyting is pretty much hardcoded, the *daily notes core plugin* can be used to set the format and location of the note, otherwise use the plugin's settings
